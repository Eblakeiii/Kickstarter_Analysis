# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The results are based on US Successful campaigns only for Theater/Plays.
The data set consisted on 412 campaigns, for the period Oct 2010 through March 2017.

Given that SDs of both Goal and Pledged amounts are greater than the average, the dataset suggests majority of amounts will be below the average, i.e., $5K.
The IQR supports the successful campaigns had final amounts in a range between $3,500 and $5,000.
The average of Goal and Pledged amounts are similar indicating $5,000 would the successful target.
Most campaigns completed in May/June.  Since the average days to complete the campaign is slightly under a month, starting a campaign in April/May seems ideal.
